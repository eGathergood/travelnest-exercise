# travelnest coding exercise
This project retrieves data from the [SpaceX API](https://github.com/r-spacex/SpaceX-API)

The program will display the following details of the latest SpaceX launch:

The name, date and details of the launch
The name, type and home port of each ship assigned to the launch.

If more time was dedicated to the project I would make the following imporvements:
- [ ] Add unit tests where appropriate
- [ ] Improve error handling
- [ ] Improve design and general UI
- [ ] Add localisation




# Getting Started with Create React App

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
